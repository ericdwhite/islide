Getting the testing libraries:
------------------------------------------------------
JSMock -- http://jsmock.sourceforge.net/
"JSMock is a fully featured Mock Object library for JavaScript that provides the necessary tools to do effective interactive based testing"

I'm going to use jsmock 1.2.2.


JsUnit -- http://www.jsunit.net/
"JsUnit is a Unit Testing framework for client-side (in-browser) JavaScript. It is essentially a port of JUnit to JavaScript."

I'm going to use jsunit 2.2alpha


Functional -- http://osteele.com/sources/javascript/functional/
"Functional is a library for functional programming in JavaScript."

I'm going to use functional 1.0.2 for the helpful 'bind' function.


Overview of TDD with JavaScript

I was this article that got me thinking I should
reimplement by image slider with test cases.


Making JSUnit Work on Firefox 3.x
------------------------------------------------------
http://digitalmihailo.blogspot.com/2008/06/make-jsunit-work-in-firefox-30.html

This killed me until I found this article.  Basically I was getting the
error: 'Permission denied to set property Window.isTestPageLoaded'.

Add a patch: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2230999&group_id=28041&atid=391976

And set 'security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy' to false by editing in the Firefox config.  To
reach the firefox config put the following in the address bar:  'about:config'


I also change the getStackTrace as my tests where always getting halted by
firebug complaing about 'foo.bar'.  Because of how getStackTrace was implemented.

I changed the following:

from
-------------------------------------
function getStackTrace() {
...
    else { // Mozilla, not ECMA
        // fake an exception so we can get Mozilla's error stack
        var testExcp;
        try
        {
            foo.bar
        }
        catch(testExcp)
        {
...

to
-------------------------------------
function getStackTrace() {
...
    else { // Mozilla, not ECMA
        // fake an exception so we can get Mozilla's error stack
        var testExcp;
        try
        {
	    // ericdwhite changed this to avoid
            // firebug from always halting.
	    var stackException = new Error("The Stack");
            throw stackException;
        }
        catch(testExcp)
        {
...
