This is intended to hold my image slide (islide) utilities for my photo web site.

I saw this (http://opiefoto.com/articles/photoslider) slider tutorial from Jesse Janzer, and I liked the output but was not happy about how it fit into my project.

I'm reusing the layout and transition types from Jesse Janzer slider tutorial.  For his original tutorial please look here:

To contact him and see what he is up to look here: jjanzer@lanthera.net http://jjanzer.subculture.org

'islide' is my attempt to implement something similar using jQuery, and Functional


My secondary plan is to use this as a learning exercise
for jQuery, JSmock, and JsUnit.

Running Test Cases:
---------------------------
The test cases can be run using JsUnit and the Rakefile in each test folder.  For example 'test/unit/Rakefile'.

Currently the test expect that browser will be launched on OSX using the 'open' command.
